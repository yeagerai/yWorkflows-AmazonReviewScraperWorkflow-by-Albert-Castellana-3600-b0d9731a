# Amazon Search Scraper Component

## Component Name
AmazonSearchScraper

## Description
The Amazon Search Scraper component is a Yeager Workflow component designed to scrape Amazon product URLs based on the provided search query. The component sends an HTTP request to the Amazon search page and then extracts the product URLs using Beautiful Soup.

## Input and Output Models
### Input Model
- `AmazonSearchScraperInput` containing the following attribute:
  - `product_name` (str) - The search query for the desired product.

### Output Model
- `AmazonSearchScraperOutput` containing the following attribute:
  - `product_urls` List[str] - A list of Amazon product URLs based on the search query.

Validation and serialization are handled by Pydantic's `BaseModel`.

## Parameters
1. `results_limit` (int) - The maximum number of product URLs to retrieve from the search results. This parameter is configurable in the component's YAML configuration file.

## Transform Function
The `transform()` method for the AmazonSearchScraper component is responsible for retrieving and processing Amazon search results for the `product_name` from the input:

1. Construct a request URL for the search results by concatenating the `product_name` with the base Amazon URL.
2. Send an HTTP GET request to the constructed URL with appropriate headers, receiving an HTTP response.
3. Parse the response content using Beautiful Soup, extracting the product URLs.
4. Limit the number of URLs based on the `results_limit` parameter.
5. Return a list of product URLs encapsulated in the `AmazonSearchScraperOutput` model.

## External Dependencies
The AmazonSearchScraper component has the following external dependencies:
1. `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` package - Used for parsing HTML content and extracting product URLs.
2. `requests` - Used to send HTTP requests and handle responses.
3. `dotenv`, `FastAPI`, `pydantic`, and `yaml` - Used for boilerplate functionalities and configurations.

## API Calls
The component sends one API call:
- An HTTP GET request to the Amazon search page (`https://www.amazon.com/s?field-keywords={product_name}`).

## Error Handling
The component does not explicitly handle errors. However, the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` packages throw exceptions for specific errors related to web requests and HTML parsing. These exceptions will propagate up the call stack and should be handled by the overarching Yeager Workflow.

## Examples
To use the AmazonSearchScraper component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Configure the component's YAML file, specifying the `results_limit`.
2. Instantiate an `AmazonSearchScraperInput` object with a `product_name` attribute.
3. Instantiate the `AmazonSearchScraper` component.
4. Invoke the component's `transform()` method with the input object, receiving an `AmazonSearchScraperOutput` object in return.
5. Use the `product_urls` attribute from the output object for further processing within the workflow.
