# Component Name

AmazonReviewScraperWorkflow

## Description

The AmazonReviewScraperWorkflow is a Yeager component designed to scrape Amazon product reviews and return a spreadsheet URL containing the scraped data. This component is part of a larger Yeager Workflow that performs specific data scraping and transformation tasks.

## Input and Output Models

### InputProduct

- `product_name` (str): Name of the Amazon product for which the reviews will be scraped.

### OutputProductReviews

- `spreadsheet_url` (str): URL of the spreadsheet containing the scraped reviews.

Both input and output data are modeled using Pydantic's BaseModel to define and validate the required fields.

## Parameters

- `args` (InputProduct): An instance of the InputProduct model containing the `product_name`.
- `callbacks` (typing.Any): Callback functions for various events within the transform method. Default value is `None`.

## Transform Function

The `transform` method of the AmazonReviewScraperWorkflow component takes the `args` and `callbacks` as input and performs the following steps:

1. Invokes the transform method of the base `AbstractWorkflow` class using the input `args` and `callbacks`. This returns a dictionary containing the results of the data transformation tasks.
2. Retrieves the spreadsheet URL from the `results_dict` using the `spreadsheet_created` key.
3. Creates an instance of the `OutputProductReviews` model with the `spreadsheet_url`.
4. Returns the `OutputProductReviews` instance containing the spreadsheet URL.

## External Dependencies

- `dotenv`: Library used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `fastapi`: Library used to build the API for handling input and output.
- `pydantic`: Library used for data validation and serialization through data models (InputProduct and OutputProductReviews).

## API Calls

The component doesn't explicitly make external API calls within the given source code. However, it is part of a larger Yeager Workflow that may require external API calls to access Amazon product reviews and create the spreadsheet containing the scraped data.

## Error Handling

Errors are not explicitly handled within the provided source code of this component. However, any exceptions that occur during the execution of the `transform` method will propagate to the caller for handling. Usage of Pydantic's BaseModel for input and output validation ensures that invalid data will be automatically rejected.
